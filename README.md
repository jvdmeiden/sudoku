Attempting to create a sudoku solver 
====================================
Some dead ends.. when attempting to create a GUI.
Can get frustrated by inconsistent behavior of colgroups..
Got frustrated the foreign object does not show up in SVG (it gets there and seems correct..)

Nested tables: why does it defy logic to make the cells square?
