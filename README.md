Attempting to create a sudoku solver 
====================================
Some dead ends.. when attempting to create a GUI.
Can get frustrated by inconsistent behavior of colgroups..
Got frustrated the foreign object does not show up in SVG (it gets there and seems correct..)

Nested tables: seems to work...

Some things remain to be done:
* implement backwards funtionality
* implement color codingvial choises
* optionally disable hints
* preloaded puzzles
* create random puzzles with various levels of difficulty
*
